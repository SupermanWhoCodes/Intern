**Intern – Problem-Solving Full-Stack Developer (MVP / Micro-SaaS)**
*On-site · 6-day work-week · “Vibe-coding” culture · Immediate start*

---

### Why we’re hiring

We’re a small, fast team turning a proof-of-concept micro-SaaS into a production-ready MVP. The product combines an **agent-oriented AI workflow layer** with custom services and a sleek UI built and iterated in **Lovable** (a prompt-driven web-app builder). We care less about which libraries you already know and **more about how quickly you can crack a problem, test a hypothesis, and ship a clean solution**.

### What you’ll tackle

| Challenge                     | What it really means                                                                                                               |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Untangle messy requirements   | Break vague goals into concrete tasks, sketch quick flow-charts, and choose the simplest architecture that can possibly work.      |
| Automate AI-powered workflows | Design pipelines on a low-code agent platform; prototype custom nodes, handle webhooks, and keep retries & logging solid.          |
| Build & glue back-end pieces  | Spin up APIs, serverless functions, and background jobs in JavaScript/TypeScript; write clear tests so we can refactor fearlessly. |
| Shape the UI in Lovable       | Use prompt-based scaffolding plus React/Tailwind tweaks to extend an existing front-end, always keeping UX friction low.           |
| Keep it running               | Add Dockerfiles, minimal CI checks, and basic observability so everyone sleeps at night.                                           |

### You’ll thrive here if you…

* **Think in first principles** – you ask *why* before you code *what*.
* **Debug like a detective** – binary-search issues, inspect payloads, read stack traces.
* **Prototype fearlessly** – rough-draft an idea in an hour, then harden it tomorrow.
* **Translate ideas into diagrams** – before jumping into your editor.
* **Enjoy “vibe-coding” sessions** – lo-fi beats, pair programming, rapid feedback.

### Helpful technical mileage (but flexible)

* Solid JavaScript/TypeScript syntax and async/await patterns
* REST/GraphQL fundamentals and JSON schema thinking
* React basics & modern CSS (you can learn Tailwind on the job)
* Git habits: branches, PRs, small commits
* Any exposure to workflow-automation tools, LLM/AI APIs, or containerisation is a bonus

### Internship logistics

* **Duration:** 3–6 months (option to extend or convert)
* **Hours:** 6 days/week, on-site (co-working studio in Chennai)
* **Mentorship:** Daily pairing with a senior engineer; weekly deep-dive code reviews
* **Culture:** Low-ego, high-curiosity, ship-early-ship-often. Mistakes are learning fuel.
